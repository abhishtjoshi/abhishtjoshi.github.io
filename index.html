                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Background During residency, each resident is observed and receives feedback based on their performance. Residency training is demanding, with some residents struggling with their academic performance. A competency-based residency training program’s success depends on its ability to identify residents with difficulty during their first year of post-graduate education and to provide them with timely intervention and support.<br><br>
                        Objective In large training programs such as Family Medicine, identifying residents at risk of failing their certification exams is difficult. We developed an AI system using state-of-the-art technologies in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Explainable AI (XAI) to detect at-risk residents automatically.<br><br>
                        Materials and Methods The research was conducted in the 2023-24 academic year. We implemented ML, DL and NLP models for prediction and performance analysis. The target variable chosen for the prediction was the determination of whether the resident would fail or pass their certification exam. XAI was used to enhance the understanding of the model’s inner workings.<br><br>
                        Results In total, there were 1382 data points of residents. The final model, Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieved an accuracy of 89.05% and an F1 score of 74.54 for the multiclass classification when multimodal (text and tabular) data was used. This model outperformed the models that only used qualitative or quantitative data exclusively.<br><br>
                        Conclusion Combining qualitative and quantitative data represents a novel approach and provided better classification results. This research demonstrates the feasibility of an automated AI system for the early identification of residents at risk of academic struggle.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a novel approach to improving text-based cancer data classification by integrating BERTopic clustering with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, combined with the Explainable Inconsistency Algorithm (EIA). The proposed method leverages advanced preprocessing techniques, including Node2Vec embeddings, to enhance both clustering and classification performance. Through the introduction of EIA, we automatically identify and eliminate outliers and discordant data points, thus improving classification accuracy and providing valuable insights into underlying data relation-ships. A key innovation in this work is the use of recommender systems for mapping clusters to labels, which improves label assignment through collaborative filtering techniques. Our experimental results show a significant increase in both accuracy and F1-score after addressing data inconsistencies, with improvements validated through statistical tests, including t-tests. This paper contributes a robust, explainable, and scalable framework for cancer data analysis, offering potential applications in other domains requiring high-precision text classification. Future work will focus on extending the EIA to other biomedical datasets, optimizing hyperparameters, and deploying the framework in real-time clinical decision-support systems.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> In every educational institution, predicting pupils’ performance is a vital responsibility. Due to this, a variety of data mining techniques, such as clustering, classification, and regression, are applied to anticipate the learner’s study behavior. By Machine Learning’s arrival, it has become vital to forecast students’ academic achievement, and this study attracts significant attention within the scientific community. In addition, the findings from this work have tremendous socio-economic consequences. One area of major research in the world of education today is educational data mining, which is the study of techniques to reveal hidden patterns in educational data. Data mining strategies succeed or fail to depend on the type and quality of the data that is being mined. Here, we provide a novel method that enhances the accuracy of prior student performance prediction by identifying and providing an explanation as to why it is rising. Using our robust machine learning ensemble models, we propose and evaluate a prediction model. The findings demonstrate that our CatBoost — an ensemble machine learning model — is superior to standard machine learning models with an accuracy of 92.27%. This new model was able to show itself to be dependable by the use of smote and hyperparameter optimization, which proved to be valuable methods and approaches. Additional features are significant as well. More critically, a unique method is utilized to increase model transparency. The SHAP values are a valuable part of the student performance prediction system, which we think should be integrated. For those educators tasked with using prediction models in education, we have found that there is a preference for models that offer both insightful insights and easy to understand predictions, as by utilizing our experiment the educator will be able to identify those students who are at early risk and inspire and encourage these students in a positive way.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The skin is the biggest and most vulnerable organ in the body, so skin illnesses are common nowadays. However, the significance of skin health is sometimes underestimated. According to one survey, around 1.79% of the world population suffers from skin-related disorders. These disorders can be fatal when they are not given treatment in their early stages. As a result, skin illnesses must be recognized and diagnosed early to avert severe dangers to one's life. However, the patient may be impacted, and they are frequently subjected to extensive examinations to determine the severity of their skin issue. As a result, we must create an expert system capable of detecting illnesses at an early stage. At the moment, just a few computerized methods are available for detecting skin illnesses, but this is an era in which substantial research is being conducted and may be further expanded. In this paper, an expert system was created using the EfficientNet B-0 model, and the model can also be used to assist specialists in more effectively and efficiently identifying and diagnosing various significant skin diseases such as (Eczema, Psoriasis & Lichen Planus, Benign Tumours, Fungal Infections, and Viral Infections). In addition, we conducted a comparison of sequential Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), EfficientNet B0, and ResNet50. Through these models, the reasons for recognized skin illness may be defined, and therapy may be offered. The Python programming language was utilized to implement the models. The dataset was obtained via DERMNET. Using EfficientNet-B0 to train the model and predict outcomes at an epoch value of 10, we attained an accuracy of 91.36%.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent years, improvements in natural language processing and computer vision have come together to provide automatic image caption generation. Image captioning is the process of creating a description for an image. Captioning an image needs the recognition of significant items, their properties, and their connections within the image. Additionally, it must create phrases that are syntactically and semantically accurate. Deep learning approaches can address the complexities and difficulties associated with image captions. This paper describes a joint model which is capable of automatically captioning images using EfficientNet-B0 and a transformer with multi-head attention. The model is an aggregation of an EfficientNet & Transformer single encoder and decoder. The encoder utilizes EfficientNet-B0, a convolutional neural network-based algorithm that generates a detailed input image, represented by embedding them into a fixed-length vector. The decoder employs a transformer, and a multi-head attention mechanism to selectively concentrate attention on certain regions of images to predict the sentence. The proposed model was trained using a large dataset Flickr8k to optimize BLEU N-Gram (N=1,2,3,4), METEOR score, and CIDEr, to assess the probability of the target description phrase given in the training images. Our studies show that the proposed model can produce captions for images automatically.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Heart disease, often called as cardiovascular illness, is a term that refers to a group of illnesses that damage the heart, most commonly manifesting as myocardial infarctions or heart failure. When the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to satisfy the body’s needs, this is referred to as heart failure. It connects a bevy of heart disease risk variables to a critical need for accurate, reliable, and pragmatic techniques for diagnosing and controlling the condition early on. Data mining is a common technique for evaluating vast volumes of data in the healthcare sector. Researchers analyze enormous volumes of complex medical data using a range of machine learning and data mining technologies, supporting doctors in the prediction of cardiac illness. This research study discusses numerous heart disease features, as well as ensemble and boosting models based on supervised learning algorithms like CatBoost, XGBoost, LGBM, etc. The goal of this study is to forecast whether such a patient will acquire heart disease. CatBoost classifier achieves the highest accuracy and F1 score, according to the results.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> A cardiovascular complication, such as a heart attack, is among the most serious contemporary health issues to confront. People diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a considerably higher risk of dying in the first year after their diagnosis. People in more and more parts of the globe are being diagnosed with myocardial infarction (MI). A report by the CDC states that statistically, someone dies every 36 s from a heart attack, and the cause of three out of four of those fatalities is a heart attack. Accurate prediction of long-term negative outcomes after an AMI may assist decide the amount of care delivered and form part of informed patient choice-making and emerging approaches that hold up the possibility of extracting new information from the present data. In this paper, we have applied different machine learning algorithms on the myocardial infarction complications database which can process and incorporate an exponentially greater number of variables and identify the intricate correlations between risk factors and ultimate outcomes. Ridge classifier and SVC have the best F1 score of 90.29% on test data which would help in the early diagnosis of acute MI. These advancements will make risk factor identification far more valuable for myocardial infarction prediction, and medical experts will concentrate on the key variables selected by the machine learning model.
