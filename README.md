# Abhisht Joshi

Hi, I’m **Abhisht Makarand Joshi**, a software developer and machine learning researcher with a love for solving real-world problems using code, AI, and clean design. I’ve built NLP systems that flag at-risk students, real-time classifiers for DNS attacks, and dashboards that actually get used.
