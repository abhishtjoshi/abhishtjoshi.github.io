# Abhisht Joshi

Hi, I’m **Abhisht Makarand Joshi**, a software developer and machine learning researcher with a love for solving real-world problems using code, AI, and clean design. I’ve built NLP systems that flag at-risk students, real-time classifiers for DNS attacks, and dashboards that actually get used.

## 🧠 Projects

### 🛰️ Dynamic DNS Exfiltration Attack Classification  
A real-time system that detects data exfiltration attacks using DNS traffic patterns.  
I built a producer in Docker that streamed **10,000+ DNS queries/sec** to Kafka. Then, I created a Kafka consumer that classified them in real-time using a sliding window. Achieved **90% accuracy** and an **85% F1 score**.

**Tools & Tech:** Python • Kafka • Docker • Scikit-learn

### 🧬 Cancer Classification using Medical Texts  
Built a text classification system to categorize cancer cases using clinical notes. Applied heavy NLP preprocessing—tokenization, cleaning, stopword removal—and implemented various ML & DL models, including LSTM and fine-tuned **BioBERT**. Achieved **98% accuracy** and **0.99 F1 score**.

**Tools & Tech:** Python • NLP • BioBERT • LSTM • Scikit-learn  
**Repo:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/abhishtjoshi/Cancer-Classification-using-Medical-Cancer-Text-Documentation-based-on-Machine-Learning-Model-and-NL)

### 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using MLOps  
Not just another ML model—this was an end-to-end pipeline. I used **DVC** for versioning, added **GitHub workflows** for CI/CD, and deployed the Random Forest model on **Heroku**. The app had YAML-driven param tuning and passed tests using **Pytest** & **Tox**. Achieved **RMSE: 0.23**.

**Tools & Tech:** Python • DVC • CI/CD • Heroku • Pytest • Random Forest  
**Repo:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/abhishtjoshi/Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-ML-and-DVC)  
*📷 Image placeholder here: `![Wine Quality](assets/wine-quality.png)`*

### 🎬 IMDb Sentiment Analysis Web App  
Built an RNN-based sentiment classifier for movie reviews. Trained the model on **Amazon SageMaker**, exposed it using an **API Gateway**, and created a minimal web frontend. Final app could classify text in real-time with **86% accuracy**.

**Tools & Tech:** PyTorch • AWS Sagemaker • API Gateway • Flask • HTML/CSS  
**Repo:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/abhishtjoshi/Project--Sentiment-Analysis)  
*📷 Image placeholder here: `![IMDb App](assets/imdb-sentiment.png)`*

### 📊 Student Performance Dashboard  
Designed an interactive dashboard that made student test data visual and meaningful. Cleaned messy CSVs, transformed them using **Power Query**, and added DAX measures for drill-down insights. Published to **Power BI Service** with auto-refresh and export support.

**Tools & Tech:** Power BI • DAX • Power Query
